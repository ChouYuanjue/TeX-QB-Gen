# TeX Question Bank Generator (TeX-QB-Gen)

> Generate question banks directly from textbooks.

Leverage OpenRouter's multimodal/language models and local OCR capabilities to extract math problems and solutions from images, web pages, or PDFs, and generate uniformly formatted TeX question banks. Each question generates an independent TeX file, summarized by `master.tex` for batch compilation.

## Background

This project was born out of the need to earn NJU labor education hours. When professors require you to organize question banks in TeX to earn these hours, why not adopt a faster solution?

## Key Features

- **Multiple Input Channels**: Images, PDFs (automatically distinguish text-based/scanned), URLs; batch fetching from Math Stack Exchange / MathOverflow using APIs.
- **Intelligent Problem Splitting**: Text PDFs locate problem boundaries via keywords; scanned versions only call OCR or multimodal models on suspected problem pages.
- **Answer Strategy**: Retain original answers/solutions; for minimal responses like "obvious" or "evident," automatically call LLM to generate `Solution (by LLM)` with a "may be inaccurate" disclaimer.
- **Unified Output**: Each question generates a `.tex` file containing `Exercise`, `Answer`, `Solution`, and `Solution (by LLM)` with metadata annotations; `master.tex` is auto-generated.
- **Caching and Retry**: OpenRouter requests are cached to disk, automatically handling rate limits and retries to reduce redundant calls.
- **Extensible Configuration**: Override models, cache, StackExchange API Key, Tesseract path, etc., via `.env`.

## Quick Start

### 1. Prepare the Environment

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configure Keys

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the following:

- `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`: API Key from [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/).
- `STACKEXCHANGE_KEY` (optional): Enhance StackExchange API quota.
- `TESSERACT_CMD` (optional): Path to Tesseract executable on Windows.
- `TEXBANK_DEFAULT_LANGUAGE` (optional): Default output language, supports `auto` (retain original), `zh` (Chinese), `en` (English).

### 3. Tesseract OCR (Local Backup)

- Windows: Install via [official package](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki) or Chocolatey.
- After installation, add the installation directory to `PATH` or set `TESSERACT_CMD` in `.env`.

### 4. Run Command

```powershell
$env:PYTHONPATH = "src"
python -m texbank.cli --input examples\sample.pdf --out out
```

Command Parameters:

| Parameter       | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| `--input/-i`    | Supports multiple inputs; use `@file` to read a list. |
| `--out/-o`      | Output directory. |
| `--keyword/-k`  | StackExchange search keywords. |
| `--max-items/-m`| StackExchange question limit. |
| `--site/-s`     | `math` or `mathoverflow`. |
| `--no-llm-solution` | Disable auto-generated solutions. |
| `--language/-l` | Output language (`auto`/`zh`/`en`), default `auto`. |
| `--verbose/-v`  | Print detailed progress logs. |
| `--debug`       | Print debug-level logs (including stack traces). |

After execution, the `out/` directory will contain `.tex` files for each question and `master.tex`.

When the specified language differs from the original question language, the pipeline automatically calls LLM to translate the question, solution, and additional solutions. Metadata records whether translation occurred.

## Detailed Processing Flow

- **Smart Page Segmentation**: Text-based PDFs extract candidate blocks using keywords (Exercise/Problem/Question/题目/例题, etc.), then generate cross-page combinations (up to 3 groups) to ensure questions and answers are on the same screen.
- **Multimodal Priority Strategy**: Candidate pages are rendered as images and submitted in batches to multimodal models, with prompts guiding the model to return only matching questions. If requests fail, logs are recorded, and it automatically falls back to local OCR or raw text parsing.
- **Fallback for Scanned PDFs**: For suspected scanned PDFs, pages are selected based on scan probability, converted to images, and reused in the image processing flow, avoiding page-by-page OCR for the entire document.
- **Question Merging and Post-Processing**: Cross-page extraction results are deduplicated and concatenated. Missing answers trigger LLM to generate `Solution (by LLM)`. Language detection and translation ensure the final output adheres to `--language` or `TEXBANK_DEFAULT_LANGUAGE` settings.
- **Observability**: With `--verbose`/`--debug`, real-time details of each block's page group attempts, fallback reasons, translation status, etc., are available, making it easier to locate bottlenecks in long processing times or failed responses.

## Key Modules

- `texbank.config`: Centralized management of settings for models, cache, OpenRouter, StackExchange, etc.
- `texbank.llm_client`: OpenRouter wrapper supporting text/multimodal requests, structured JSON parsing, retries, and disk caching.
- `texbank.pdf_utils`: PDF text/scan detection, keyword segmentation, scanned page image extraction.
- `texbank.pipeline`: Unified pipeline for processing image/PDF/URL inputs and outputting `ProblemItem` lists.
- `texbank.texgen`: Renders `ProblemItem` into TeX files and generates `master.tex`.
- `texbank.stackexchange`: Calls StackExchange API to search and fetch complete questions and answers.

## Model Recommendations

- **Structured Extraction**: `google/gemini-2.5-flash-lite` (economical and sensitive to question structure).
- **Multimodal Understanding**: `google/gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview` (stable performance for images with formulas).
- **Solution Generation**: `deepseek/deepseek-chat` (cost-effective); switch to `meta-llama/llama-3.1-70b-instruct` for complex reasoning.
- **Supplementary Reasoning/Validation**: `deepseek/deepseek-r1` as a low-cost alternative.

For offline/local models, replace model names in `.env` and deploy HTTP proxies yourself.

## Run Tests

```powershell
$env:PYTHONPATH = "src"
pytest
```

Tests rely on a stubbed OpenRouter client to ensure basic logic correctness without real network calls.

## FAQ

- **429 Too Many Requests**: OpenRouter rate-limiting. Retry later or request a higher quota.
- **Tesseract Not Found**: Ensure `tesseract.exe` is in `PATH` after installation or set `TESSERACT_CMD`.
- **StackExchange Returns 502**: API occasionally fluctuates; retry or reduce request volume.
- **TeX Special Characters**: Escape `%` in comments before rendering; formulas remain unchanged.
